## Recommendations
- For the least ordered item which is the chicken tacos, the recipe should be thoroughly checked and improved to suite the customers pallate. A market survey can also be carried out by customers to know the specific things they dont like about the dish and what areas they want them to improve on.
- On mondays, all staffs hands should be on deck to ensure smooth running of orders to their respective customers. Advertisements and promos can be carried out on other days to boost the daily orders.
- With the busiest time of the day being by 12pm, the above suggestion can also be applied.
